If you want to download and play Unreal Tournament 2004 on your PC, you will need a few things. First, you will need a copy of the game itself. You can buy it from online stores like Steam or GOG.com, or you can download it for free from the Internet Archive. Second, you will need a crack file that will bypass the CD check and allow you to play without inserting the disc. You can find the crack file on various websites that host game patches and mods. Third, you will need a program that can extract compressed files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
  
Here are the steps to download and play Unreal Tournament 2004 on your PC:
  
1. Download the game from your preferred source. If you download it from the Internet Archive, you will get a ZIP file that contains four ISO files. These are disc images that you can mount on your virtual drive or burn on physical discs.
2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your hard drive. You will see four folders named UT2004-DVD1, UT2004-DVD2, UT2004-DVD3, and UT2004-DVD4.
3. Mount or insert the first disc image (UT2004-DVD1) and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions to install the game on your PC. You will need to enter a serial key during the installation. You can use any of these keys: `6L3X-7U8G-9Q9K-M2AU-2B53`, `LYR2-R5HL-URP6-J8A6-1911`, `9G3L-6T8G-8Q8W-K8A3-FD53`, or `9N69-F4Y9-Y8Y8-B7A7-6120`.
4. When prompted, mount or insert the second disc image (UT2004-DVD2) and continue the installation. Repeat this process for the third and fourth disc images (UT2004-DVD3 and UT2004-DVD4).
5. Download the crack file from a reliable source. You can search for "Unreal Tournament 2004 crack" on Google or any other search engine and find several links. Make sure to scan the file for viruses before opening it.
6. Extract the crack file to a folder on your hard drive. You will see a file named `UT2004.exe`. This is the executable file that will launch the game without requiring the disc.
7. Copy and paste the `UT2004.exe` file to the folder where you installed the game. This is usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Unreal Tournament 2004\System`. You will be asked to replace the existing file. Click yes.
8. Double-click on the `UT2004.exe` file to start the game. Enjoy!
